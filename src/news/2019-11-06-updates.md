Many great events coming up! IMC club will feature Mike Bragg discussing ADS B on Tuesday Nov 12.

We have Young Eagle and the Landing contest Saturday November 16. We still need pilots, if you are EAA qualified, please sign up to fly some Young Eagles. We also have slots available to participate in the Landing contest.

The Holiday get together is Saturday December 7, 11-2. It will be a combo of grilling out and people bringing side dishes. Let us know if your coming and contact me at craigpilots@gmail.com
I am also looking for someone who wants to present at next months trip talk? Did you take a great flying vacation or cross country and want to share the flight and destination. Contact me at craigpilots@gmail.com so we can schedule.
