Feeling bad because you meant to RSVP to the Holiday party this Saturday (December 7) at Craig and forgot?  All is not lost, reply to this email and we will add you to the list.  We just need to get a count of attendees so we have enough food.

BTW Thank you to all those that have already RSVP'd, you all can ignore this email.

We are providing Burgers, Hot Dogs and Drinks (Soda and water).  We also will have condiments, plates and plastic-ware.  Please consider bringing a side or dessert to share. 

Party is Saturday, 11 AM - 2 PM (1600Z-1900Z), at Durkeeville Hangar 6307.  For those not familiar, Durkeeville is the first right after you enter the airport.  Go to the gate and we will let you in (the secret password is FEED ME).  Please park such that you don't block the road or any hangars and as always be careful.  As for finding the exact hangar, look for the people standing around making food.
