# Calling All Women Pilots!

From Meredith Holladay;

"As chair of the First Coast chapter of the Ninety Nines, one of my primary goals is to bring Jacksonville area women pilots into the foreground of our existing aviation community. Here at CRG, we have several intermingled groups of pilots, including EAA Chapter 193 and the Craig Airport Pilots Association. There are also several flight schools and corporate operators. Male or female, private pilot or ATP, aircraft owner or renter, we all have a lot to share with one another."

"I would like to invite each of you to join us for an informal get-together on Saturday, June 15 at noon, rain or shine. My company, Holladay Aviation, will host the meeting at our hangar at the Craig Air Center. We will provide burgers and hot dogs on the grill, as well as a cooler full of soft drinks. If you plan to attend, please bring a small container of your favorite side dish or dessert to share with the group. Kids and significant others are welcome!"

"During the event we will have an informal meeting to discuss plans for the next annual Spot Landing Contest at CRG. We will also revisit our chapterâ€™s plan to repaint the compass rose at CRG."
