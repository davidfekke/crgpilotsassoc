## The Short Field Landing Contest will now be held on Sunday November 17, 2019.

Rain and low clouds are forcing us to move the Young Eagles/Landing Contest to this Sunday the 17th.

You should be notified directly if you were involved but if not, consider yourself notified. All timing to remain the same, just come a day later.
