IMC club is Tuesday January 14th at 6PM.   Now that everyone is rested up from New Years, time to focus on training again. Remember IMC club is for everyone (Students to ATPs and even the curious non pilot). Go ahead and RSVP so Meredith knows about how many are coming.   https://www.holladayaviation.com/eaa-imc-club/  

Starting to think about 2020 and what we should do as a group.  I plan to have a least one hangar Coffee, we have had one each previous year.  The BBQ was fun so we will try another one before it gets too hot.  What other ideas do you have that you would participate in?   

I started a discussion on our facebook group but if you are not on FB, please reply to this [email](mailto:craigpilots@gmail.com) with your thoughts.
