Saturday December 4th @10:30 AM

Hangar C5 – Craig Air center

It’s been a while since we had a get together.  In years past I held this event when my plane was in annual.  That was August this year and it was too darn hot.  CAPA is more of an idea than an organization so this is not a meeting.  Just an opportunity to meet your fellow pilots and aviation enthusiasts.  Mill about, drink coffee and swap stories.

Last time we did this there were only about 50 people on the list.  We now have 400+ people involved so I really need to get a good idea of how much coffee and how many donuts to get.  Please either reply via email or Facebook but not both as this will confuse me.  Also let me know if it’s just you or if you are bringing a friend/spouse/Significant Other/Etc.

Hope to see you all there.
