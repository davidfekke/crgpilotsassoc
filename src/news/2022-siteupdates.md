Most of the group communication for Craig Airport Pilots Association occurs over email or our Facebook group. The Facebook group remains very popular, but we are expanding our social media footprint to both Linkedin and Locals.com.

[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12242408/) has always been a very popular site for professional networking. While we have had a group up on Linkedin, we have not actively promoted the [group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12242408/) we just wanted to make sure that everyone knew that it was there for our use.

We have also added a [locals site](https://craigpilots.locals.com/). If you are not familiar with locals, there are a Florida based company that allows you to create a group site just for your group. Some of our members do not like to use alternative social networks, so this might be a good group to join if you are not on FB or Linkedin.
