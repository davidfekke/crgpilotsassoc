## Anyone know somebody who wants to be an actor?

We just got the following message from Brad Martin at JAXEX about how they are looking for volunteers to be in training movies.

*"On Monday, July 22, JAXEX will be updating our security and airfield driving training videos. Beginning around 8am we will be filming at various points around the airport.  We are looking for a few volunteers to star in these videos, no acting experience required. If interested, contact Tim Croxton at 904-741-5064 or email tim.croxton@flyjaxex.com."*
