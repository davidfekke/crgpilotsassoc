April 21 Wings Over Suwannee.  It starts Friday and goes through Sunday.  [http://www.wingsoversuwannee.com/](http://www.wingsoversuwannee.com/)  There is camping for those who like but the plan is for a morning departure to see the event with a same day return.    Suwannee is ~78 nm almost due West so less than an hour flight for most of us. [http://www.airnav.com/airport/24J](http://www.airnav.com/airport/24J)

Note:    While this sounds like a lot of fun, remember safety first.  Each pilot is responsible for their flight including planning, weather and navigation.
