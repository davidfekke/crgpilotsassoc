Craig airport pilots association grows to 34 people.  Celebrates with Coffee and Doughnuts!!!
CAPA held its first event at Craig.  Coffee and doughnuts in the hangar.   Lots of good ideas for the group like  planned fly outs to nearby events and a Spring time BBQ.  Great to meet a bunch of other aviation enthusiasts.
