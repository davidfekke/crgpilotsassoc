Welcome to CAPA the Craig Airport Pilots Association.  We are a group of pilots keeping in touch.  There is no formal membership at this time and no formal organization.  If you wish to be part of the group, please fill out the contact form and we will include you when sharing information.  Give us as little or as much information as you like.  Participate as much or as little as you like.  

Also this group is starting by word of mouth.  Please let any other Craig pilots know so we can sign them up too.  

Thank you, David Cristol
