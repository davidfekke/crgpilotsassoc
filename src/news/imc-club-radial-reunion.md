April 6-8 The Staggerwing & Radial Reunion will once again gather at Craig.  This will be the second year.  The event requires registration and a small fee.  I attended last year and it was lots of fun and many cool planes came from near and far.  If you have a round engine, you need to be there.  If you don’t have one, head out anyway to hear that great rumble. [http://www.radialreunion.com/](http://www.radialreunion.com/)
