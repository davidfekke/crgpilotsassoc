## Radio Controlled Airplane Competition

Holladay Aviation renter pilot Doug Bracey has invited us to join him for the International Miniature Aerobatic Club (IMAC) competition at the Gateway RC Club (http://gatewayrc.com) in Jacksonville on Saturday, July 20. The club is located at 3461 Lannie Road. Doug says there will be lots of aerobatic maneuvers and lots of nice RC planes on display. There is a practice day on Friday, July 19 and the main event is on Saturday, July 20. Pilots usually begin flying around 8:30 a.m. and the event winds down around 5 p.m. Admission is free and you are welcome to bring coolers and chairs to relax under their large pavilion. Doug has been flying RC airplanes for more than 40 years and says it’s what motivated him to earn his private pilot certificate in 1975.
