## Save the Date!!!! November 16, 2019. 

We are planning a Landing contest and Young Eagle rally, maybe more. Block your calendar to join us at KCRG. We will need support from the local community, we will need pilots for Young Eagles and everyone is encouraged to show how great their landing skills are. Start practicing now!  

Watch the Facebook Group and Website for more information as well.  We will have a volunteer signup and contest signup on the web soon.
