You may have noticed the run up area and taxiway Charlie at end of 23 was/is closed.  A reminder to check those Notams while they finish the runway work.  I hear that it may all be done the first week of June but I will believe it when tower clears me for take off on 32.

 

The June 15 BBQ is around the corner.  If you have not RSVP’d, please take a moment to do so.  Info on the BBQ.

 

Please RSVP to Meredith Holladay via email [meredith@holladayaviation.com](mailto:meredith@holladayaviation.com), or call her at (904) 625-4318.

 

We now have a Facebook page as well for those who like FB.  Go ahead and start posting your flying adventures.  [Craig Pilots Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/849967972062524/)

 

 

BBQ Complete info

Meredith Holladay has cordially invited CAPA and several related groups to an open house for food, fun, camaraderie and to chat about future plans at KCRG.

 

Here at CRG, we have several intermingled groups of pilots, including EAA Chapter 193, the Ninety Nines and the Craig Airport Pilots Association. There are also several flight schools and corporate operators. Private pilot or ATP, aircraft owner or renter, we all have a lot to share with one another.

 

Meredith would like to invite each of you to an informal get-together on Saturday, June 15 at noon, rain or shine. Holladay Aviation will host the meeting at their hangar at the Craig Air Center. They will provide burgers and hot dogs on the grill, as well as a cooler full of soft drinks. If you plan to attend, please bring a small container of your favorite side dish or dessert to share with the group. Kids and significant others are welcome!

 

During the event we will have an informal meeting to discuss plans for the next annual Spot Landing Contest at CRG. We will also revisit the Ninety Nines’ plan to repaint the compass rose at CRG.

 

Looking forward to seeing you all on June 15!  If you missed the last coffee, now is your chance to meet your fellow Craig Pilots and you don’t even have to wake up early.

 

Please RSVP to Meredith Holladay via email (meredith@holladayaviation.com), or call her at (904) 625-4318.
