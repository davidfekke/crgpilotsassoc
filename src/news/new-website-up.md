### The Craig Aircraft Pilots Association has launched a new Website

We now have a new website up and running. We have some new capabilities like getting the current weather on the field, along with resources and services. If there is anything we missed, or you would like to have added, please contact our webmaster, David Fekke at [david.fekke@gmail.com](mailto:davidfekke@gmail.com).
