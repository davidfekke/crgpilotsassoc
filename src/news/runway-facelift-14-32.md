2-5-19 Runway 14/32 face lift

On the morning of February 18th, JAXEX will close Runway 14/32 from the end of 14 to the LAHSO, this is to allow milling and resurfacing of the runway. This closure will include taxiways A3, A5 and Echo.   Runway 5/23 will be the only available runway during this time.  This work is scheduled for 45 calendar days. 

And then beginning approximately April 8 work will begin within the intersection of Runway 32 and 23. During this time, the airport will close from 11PM to 5AM. This closure will leave only 3500ft available for takeoffs.    JAXEX will displace the threshold of runway 23 850ft leaving 3150ft available for landing. Taxiways Charlie and Foxtrot will be closed. PAPIs for Runway 23 will be taken out of service. Temporary displaced threshold markings and lights will be installed for runway 23.  This work is scheduled for 45 calendar days.  

The approximate completion date for this work is May 23th. There will be additional runway and airport closings to paint permanent runway markings after this date.This schedule is for your planning purposes, with the understanding that this schedule may change over time. 

I will post and email updates as they are provided.
