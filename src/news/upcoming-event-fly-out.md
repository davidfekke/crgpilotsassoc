7-1-18-  Upcoming event - Fly out

There is a Fly in BBQ at Adel GA.  I went to one of these last year and the folks were friendly.  They put out a spread and ask for donations to cover the cost of lunch.  If we have enough people I will call them and give a headcount.  Don't know about the weather yet other than it will be hot.  It is in a hangar so at least you can have shade to eat.

Info below is what I got from https://www.funplacestofly.com/aviation-event-details.asp?EventID=23208.  It is a 111 nm mile flight.  There is some restricted airspace (R-3008) around Moody AFB so flight following is a good idea.

**Cook County (15J), Adel, GA**

BBQ Fly In - July 14, 2018Second Saturday. Coffee and donuts - 10:30am. BBQ starts 11:30 am. Before the Oshkosh-WI Airventure, July Second Saturday will be one of our BBQ Fly-Ins again at Cook County Airport.
