Fly out planned for April 21.  Wings Over Suwannee.  It starts Friday and goes through Sunday.  http://www.wingsoversuwannee.com/  There is camping for those who like but the plan would be a morning departure to see the event with a same day return.   Look for more info in an upcoming email but save the date.  Suwannee is ~78 nm almost due West so less than an hour flight for most of us.

Note:    While this sounds like a lot of fun, remember safety first.  Each pilot is responsible for their flight including planning, weather and navigation.
